Very simple twitter bot which posts a tweet to the linked account at a set time interval. 

Code is copied from https://medium.com/@SeloSlav/how-to-make-a-scary-russian-twitter-bot-with-java-b7b62768a3ac

I used this as a simple project in order to practice git, and to see if I could get a simple bot working. 
Further improvements could be made to make it not as arbitrary, but as it currently stands it does what it is supposed to.
